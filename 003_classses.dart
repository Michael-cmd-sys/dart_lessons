 * Welcome again to dart. An OO-based language. (Object Oriented)
 * Similar to python, dart has no real primitive types 
 * which means that all data types in dart is actually an object
 * and thus they can't be overloaded. Actions such as 
 * inheritance and encapsulation are a bit different here due to this.
 * Yet fret not, for whatever dart takes away, it makes for in a wonwderful way
